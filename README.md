---

- Song, artist, album art, time bar and clickable links on your status
- Only Apple Music and Spotify are ever shown, and no ads or branding appear on your status
- A tiny tray app (about 125 KB) that updates itself

## Install

Run `AppleMusicSpotifyPresence-Setup.exe`. It adds the app to the Start menu, and doesn't need admin rights.

It needs Windows 10 or 11, the Discord desktop app, and [Apple Music](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pfhdd62mxs1) from the Microsoft Store or the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/download/windows/) app.

## Use

Play something in Apple Music or Spotify and your Discord status follows. All settings are in the tray icon's menu, next to the clock, and changes apply right away. **Music apps** picks which apps are shown.

If your Spotify account is connected to Discord, turn off **Display Spotify as your status** in Discord's Settings → Connections, or the song shows twice.

## Privacy

- Only the Apple Music and Spotify apps are read. Web players and every other app are ignored.
- Personal station names and your country never appear on your status.
- The app looks up album art with Apple's iTunes Search API, sending the song's title, artist and album. It also checks GitHub for updates. You can turn off both in the menu.

## Advanced

**More → Advanced settings file** opens `%APPDATA%\AppleMusicSpotifyPresence\config.ini`, where every option is explained. Running `AppleMusicSpotifyPresence.exe --dump` prints exactly what would be sent to Discord.

## Development

```
cargo test
cargo build --release
```

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). To release, add the version's notes to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), then run `scripts\release.ps1 1.2.3`. GitHub Actions builds the installer and publishes the release, and installed copies update themselves.
